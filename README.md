## About Me

As a Full Stack Developer with over four years of experience, I have a deep passion for crafting solutions using AI. My expertise lies in Python and TypeScript, and I am dedicated to honing my skills to deliver outstanding products. I earned a first-class Master's degree in Physics from Loughborough University in 2019, further solidifying my technical foundation.

## Professional projects I have contributed to:

- **Reva**: A DLOPS desktop application that streamlines training of deep learning models for CV tasks such as classification and object detection.
- **Zene**: An inference engine for CV built in C++ that gained an innovation award from the Thai BOI.
- **Bundle Builder**: Shopify app by Eight providing bundling options to thousands of merchants and processing millions of dollars worth of orders per month.
